## - Note that this default DriverManagerEncoding of UTF-32 is for iODBC.
## - unixODBC uses UTF-16 by default.
## - If unixODBC was compiled with -DSQL_WCHART_CONVERT, then UTF-32 is the correct value.
##   Execute 'odbc_config --cflags' to determine if you need UTF-32 or UTF-16 on unixODBC
## - SimbaDM can be used with UTF-8 or UTF-16.
##   The DriverUnicodeEncoding setting will cause SimbaDM to run in UTF-8 when set to 2 or UTF-16 when set to 1.
